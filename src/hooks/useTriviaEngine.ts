// src/hooks/useTriviaEngine.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The Trivia brain — wedge selection, question drawing, scoring, streaks,
// steals, turn rotation and win detection. Deliberately mirrors useCardEngine:
//   • optsRef so callbacks never read stale props
//   • ref-held "used" sets, with module-level memory across games in one app
//     session so "play again" doesn't replay the same questions
//   • the screen owns animation, layout and navigation; the engine owns rules
//
// Trivial-Pursuit rules encoded here:
//   • correct → keep the phone and go again (the roll-again rule)
//   • correct on a wedge you don't hold → win that wedge
//   • wrong → drink, phone passes on
//   • collect every required wedge → you enter the FINAL phase, where the group
//     picks the category. Get it right and you win; get it wrong and play
//     returns to normal.
//
// House rules layered on top (both optional, both off-by-default-safe):
//   • STREAKS — 3 correct in a row starts giving out bonus sips per answer.
//   • STEALS  — a missed question passes to the next player, who can take the
//     wedge off them. A failed steal costs less than an outright miss.
