// Word pack for Word Traitors!
//
// Unlike the trivia banks, words.json is HAND-AUTHORED and is the source of
// truth — there is no converter, because there is no messy upstream format to
// clean up. Add words by editing that file directly, then run:
//
//   node src/data/ValidateTraitors.js
//
// Ids are derived from the word rather than stored, so the JSON stays in the
// simple { word, hint } shape that's pleasant to extend by hand.
//
// No React Native imports, so this is testable without a device.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
